# ðŸ”§ Upcoming Ren'Py Tool Updates

> *Expected period `(Nov.2024 ~ Feb.2025)`*

### 1. Lipsync Tool
- **v1.02**
  - Issue fix (using Native class inheritence, to avoid current issue on conflicts)
  - Simpler call structure but may require specifying audio file names.
- **v1.03**: Focus on automationâ€”easier audio/dialogue syncing through Excel sheets or graphic viewer.

### 2. Layout Tool
- **Future - v1.02**
  - alpha/zoom control, clipboard support for coordinates.
  - easy due to code design which currently enables custom transitions on hovered/active item.
- **Future - v2.01**
  - Adding interface for simple transition adding/previewing
  - Custom transitions for `onhide/onshow`, stacking, and smooth ATL templates.

### 3. Interactive Game Plugin
- **Issue**: Python logic conflicted with Ren'Py rollback.
- **Solution**: Updates to use native Ren'Py screen language and timer functions.

### 4. RadioButton/ButtonGroup Plugin
- **High Priority**: Simplify usage with flags, customizable options, and ready-to-use examples without deep Python/Ren'Py knowledge.
